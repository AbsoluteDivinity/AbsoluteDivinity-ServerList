![Screenshot](https://i.absolutedivinity.net/2017-05-17_00-49-49.png)
This is our custom made server list for our own servers.
It is build on top of angular and uses our own api located at http://api.absolutedivinity.net

***

## Development
This project is based on my own [Angular 4 Startup](https://github.com/ItsDizzy/angular4-startup) repo and so uses the same way of building.
First off all you will need to install some modules, use `npm install` to achieve that.
After that you can simply just run `npm start` or `npm run start`, this will start a local development webserver at http://localhost:8080

## Production
Do you want to have this on your own webserver? Thats fairly easy, just run `npm run build`.
The builded project will be located in `dist`, just upload the content from this folder on your prefered webserver.
